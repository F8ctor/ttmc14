        1. You are not entitled to service or equipment. Attachments are a privilege, not a right.
        2. You must be fully dressed to obtain service. Cryosleep underwear is non-permissible.
        3. The Quartermaster has the final say and the right to decline service. Only the Acting Commander may override their decisions.
        4. Please treat your Requisitions staff with respect. They work hard.
